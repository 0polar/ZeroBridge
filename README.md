# ZeroBridge

ZeroNet proxy with pre-rendering
- make ZeroNet readable for search engine crawler
- visit ZeroNet with NoScript on

## How to use

ZeroBridge assume your ZeroNet client at port `43110`
1. run `npm i puppeteer --save`
2. run `node prerender.js`
3. view http://localhost:8080 (service runs on `0.0.0.0:8080`)

## Restriction

Pre-rendered pages will be read-only, so it is impossible to:
- log-in and write something
- JavaScript action (such as "load more" button)

## Demo
